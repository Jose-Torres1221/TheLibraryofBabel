"crouzon syndrome is one of the most common craniofacial syndromes and is inherited as autosomal dominant with variable expression . 
 we report an 11 and a half - year - old boy with crouzon syndrome with severe growth retardation . 
 he had hydrocephalus since infancy and recently suffered from frequent dizziness . 
 his bone age was only 5 years according to the greulich and pyle atlas . 
 magnetic resonance imaging showed shallow orbits , obstructive hydrocephalus , and cerebellar tonsil herniation . 
 growth hormone provocative tests revealed a reduced peak growth hormone response in both insulin and clonidine tests . 
 severe iron deficiency anemia was noted at the same time . 
 molecular analysis identified a common mutation point of cys278phe for crouzon syndrome in exon iiia of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( fgfr2 ) gene . 
 since growth retardation is not a common feature of crouzon syndrome , we reviewed the literature for the incidence of hydrocephalus in crouzon syndrome and the association with growth hormone deficiency .",The paper report case of an 11 and a half-year-old boy with crouzon syndrom with severe growth retardation,Case study
"release and reception of extracellular atp by leukocytes plays a critical role in immune responses to infection , injury and cardiovascular disease . 
 leukocytes of both the innate , adaptive immune and central nervous system express a repertoire of cell surface receptors for atp ( p2x and p2y receptors ) and its metabolites . 
 atp acts as a damage - associated molecule pattern ( damp ) released by injured or dying cells . 
 detection of released atp by neighboring leukocytes initiates inflammation and wound healing . 
 however , recent evidence from our group and others suggests atp release by leukocytes themselves serves to regulate homeostatic mechanisms and coordinate responses to external pro - inflammatory cues . 
 examples include the homeostatic control of intracellular calcium and regulation of migratory guidance during chemotactic response to external cues . 
 though there has been some progress in elucidating atp release mechanisms of some mammalian cells types , release conduits and coupling signal transduction machinery remain larger elusive for leukocytes . 
 our recent studies suggest a role for secretory lysosomes in releasing atp in monocytes . though poorly defined , 
 targeting atp release mechanisms in leukocytes have great anti - inflammatory potential .",The paper suggests that atp release by leukocytes themselves serves to regulate homeostatic mechanisms and coordinate responses to external pro-inflammatory cues. Targeting atp release mechanisms in leukocytes have great anti-inflammatory potential.,Analytical
"neurofibromas ( nf ) are benign tumors of neural origin , of which roughly 90% appear as solitary lesions . 
 they are classified into cutaneous , subcutaneous , and plexiform subtypes . 
 plexiform neurofibromas are the least common variant and usually are pathognomonic for nf i. here , we present a very rare case of isolated plexiform neurofibroma with a painless enlarging mass of the tongue of an 11-year - old girl . 
 this rare benign tumor has the potential for malignant transformation , and the diagnosis was difficult owing to the patient 's age and to the insidious clinical presentation .

"objectivea number of studies have found that reduced birth weight is associated with type 2 diabetes later in life ; however , the underlying mechanism for this correlation remains unresolved . 
 recently , association has been demonstrated between low birth weight and single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) at the cdkal1 and hhex - ide loci , regions that were previously implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes . in order to investigate whether type 2 diabetes risk  conferring alleles associate with low birth weight in our caucasian childhood cohort , we examined the effects of 20 such loci on this trait.research design and methodsusing data from an ongoing genome - wide association study in our cohort of 5,465 caucasian children with recorded birth weights , we investigated the association of the previously reported type 2 diabetes  associated variation at 20 loci including tcf7l2 , hhex - ide , pparg , kcnj11 , slc30a8 , igf2bp2 , cdkal1 , cdkn2a/2b , and jazf1 with birth weight.resultsour

"background : abnormal lipid homeostasis has been reported in sickle cell anaemia ( sca ) as well as in other haematological disorders 
 . however , there is little information on the lipid profile of sca subjects in vaso - occlusive crisis ( voc ) . 
 this study determined the lipid profile of adult sca subjects in voc and in steady state ( ssca).materials and methods : fifty - eight ( 58 ) adults with hbss ( 30 in steady state and 28 in vaso - occlusive crisis ) and 24 age - matched healthy individuals with hbaa genotype were recruited into this study . 
 standard methods were used for the determination of blood pressure ( bp ) , packed cell volume ( pcv ) , total white blood cell count ( wbc ) and haemoglobin phenotype . 
 after an overnight fast , 5 ml of venous blood was obtained from each ssca and the controls while samples were collected upon admission in the voc group . 
 plasma lipid profile was determined using enzymatic method . 
 differences between two groups were determined using independent student 's t - test or man - whitney u as appropriate . 
 p - values less than 0.05 were considered significant.results:plasma total cholesterol ( tc ) and high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) were significantly lower while the ratio of triglyceride ( tg ) to hdl ( tg / hdl ) was significantly higher in ssca compared with the controls . 
 low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) and tc were significantly lower in sca subjects in voc compared with controls . 
 however , tc , tg , ldl and tg / hdl were significantly lower while hdl was significantly higher in voc compared with ssca.conclusion:sickle cell anaemia subjects have defective fasting lipid metabolism which becomes pronounced with voc .",The paper determined the lipid profile of adult sickle cell anaemia subjects in vaso-occlusibe crisis  (voc) and in steady state.

"this study histometrically evaluated the effect of forced alcohol intake by stressed animals on the severity of ligature - induced periodontitis in rats . 
 thirty - two rats were randomly divided in four groups : group gal  alcohol and ligature ; group gasl  alcohol , chronic physical stress , and ligature ; gnc  negative control ; 
 gpc  positive control . 
 gal and gasl received 20% ethanol ad libitum , and gnc received water ad libitum for 60 days . 
 after 24 hours of exposition to alcohol intake  by gal and gasl  
 immobilization was applied as a chronic stressor in the gasl group for a two - month period , six times a week , in random hours . 
 the means of the respective groups were statistically compared ( analysis of variance and tukey tests , p < 0.05 ) . 
 the most severe periodontal breakdown was observed in nonstressed animals which drank alcohol ( gal ) , followed by stressed animals exposed to alcohol ( gasl ) . 
 gasl did not differ from the positive control group ( gpc ) . 
 the negative control group showed the lowest values of periodontal breakdown ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 conclusions . non - stressed alcohol consumer animals showed the most severe pattern of periodontal breakdown . 
 although stressed animals which were forced to drink alcohol showed poorer periodontal status than the negative controls , their results were similar to those of positive controls .","The paper histometrically evaluated the effect of forced alcohol intake by stressed animals on the severity of ligature - induced periodontitis in rats .

"clinical interventions using protein kinase c ( pkc ) modulators have been proposed for eradication of hiv-1-infected cellular reservoirs which persist in patients despite prolonged antiretroviral therapy . 
 the effects of some of these agents have not been assessed in a developing vertebrate model . 
 this study examines the developmental and toxicological effects of these compounds on zebrafish embryos and larvae . 
 treatment of zebrafish through the first week of development with various pkc pathway modulators did not elicit gross physical defects or elevated incidences of death at lower doses . 
 higher concentrations resulted in rapid death for both later - stage embryos and larvae . 
 each compound had a threshold dose for lethality . 
 the defined nonlethal doses may be useful toward assessing the effects of modulating pkc activity on zebrafish development . 
 they may further provide some guidance for the potential dosing of pkc modulators in clinical trials toward the goal of hiv-1 reservoir eradication ."," this study examines the developmental and toxicological effects of these compounds on zebrafish embryos and larvae .   the defined nonlethal doses may be useful toward assessing the effects of modulating pkc activity on zebrafish development .

"according to the hippocrates theorem  let food be your medicine and medicine be your food  , dietary interventions may induce changes in the metabolic and inflammatory state by modulating the expression of important genes involved in the chronic disorders . 
 the aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of long - term ( 14 months ) use of biologically active substances - enriched diet ( base - diet ) on transcriptomic profile of rats liver . 
 the experiment was conducted on 36 sprague  dawley rats divided into two experimental groups ( fed with control or base - diet , both n  =  18 ) . 
 control diet was a semi - synthetic diet formulated according to the nutritional requirements for laboratory animals . 
 the base - diet was enriched with a mixture of polyphenolic compounds , -carotene , probiotics , and n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids . in total , n  =  3,017 differentially expressed ( de ) genes were identified , including n  =  218 de genes between control and base groups after 3  months of feeding and n  =  1,262 after 14  months . base - diet influenced the expression of genes involved particularly in the gonadotrope cell activation pathway and guanylate cyclase pathway , as well as in mast cell activation , gap junction regulation , melanogenesis and apoptosis . 
 especially genes involved in regulation of gnrh were strongly affected by base - diet . 
 this effect was stronger with the age of animals and the length of diet use .
