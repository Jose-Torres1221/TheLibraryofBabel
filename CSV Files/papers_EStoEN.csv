0," Fires are part of the cycle of some ecosystems, which can cause the degradation of others. Some of its causes are mainly anthropogenic, including poorly extinguished fires, agricultural activities and garbage disposal, which generate habitat loss and large-scale air pollution. The present work refers to the application of a genetic algorithm based on an ant colony to generate, theoretically, the verification routes for the monitoring and early detection of forest fires in the State of Mexico by means of unmanned aerial devices, as it is one of the entities with the highest number of such incidents in Mexico. The data used in the proposal were extracted from the records generated by the National Forestry Commission (Conafor). During the analysis process, the municipalities where effects have occurred were filtered in at least three different geographical locations. In the evaluation process, the developed software deployed the routes in which the shortest distances were obtained, rearranging the extracted localities Finally, the map is displayed in which those where a forest fire has occurred are located, as well as the approximate distance of the total route of the route The results showed an average reduction of 54% in the new planned routes, compared to a sequential route"," This study proposes a new method for the early detection of forest fires in the State of Mexico, using genetic algorithms and drones to optimize monitoring routes, which contributes significantly to the prevention and control of these events.",Analítico
1," The computational program for the modeling of the fault by overturning in two dimensions (2D), called volteoLab, allows to interpret the fault mode type overturning (toppling in English) of a set of rock blocks on a road slope under the analysis of contact loads and gravitational forces in an analysis framework VolteoLab has been carried out using the limit equilibrium method In this method, the calculation of the weight forces of each study block and the friction forces at the base of them is proposed (i.e. and the forces of mechanical resistance to the cut and the normal to the supporting plane of the blocks) On the other hand, the concept of transfer coefficient (p) is used, which relates the components of gravitational forces to the spatial position of each block in relation to a guide block of strategic location (called a crest block and with a location index in this text denoted as m) whose physical meaning divides the slope of analysis into two zones: the cut zone and the crown zone. With the transfer coefficient and the location of the crest block, it is possible to identify the vulnerable parts of the slope and, in particular, it is possible to have a numerical value of another variable that will define the overall stability of the slope, which is a horizontal force on the foot of the slope, called here as an anchoring force. If this force is negative, the slope is stable and if"," The anchorage force, calculated by VolteoLab, is a key parameter for assessing the overall stability of a slope A negative value of this force indicates that the slope is stable, while a positive value suggests a risk of overturning failure This software is a valuable tool for geotechnical engineers in the evaluation and design of slopes",Analítico
2," The study deals with the identification of the development of spatial visual skills in tasks of representation of revolutionary solids and conversion between registers to calculate their volume, carried out by engineering students The skills that are studied are visual organization and scanning and, reconstruction, generation and manipulation of the image. A mixed study was done with a triangulation design. The subjects were 33 second semester students studying integral calculus. Assisted tasks were designed by GeoGebra based on indicators created for each skill The results indicate a significant improvement in skills, with a rebound in image generation and manipulation. These skills are high-level because they require the visualization of three-dimensional configurations and the mental manipulation of these images. It was identified that the development of these skills contributes to the representation of revolutionary solids, but for the calculation of their volume it is necessary the conversion between the verbal, graphic, symbolic and algebraic registers, to visualize and represent the solid, determine the correct expression of the volume and calculate the defined integral obtained"," This study contributes to the field of engineering education by providing empirical evidence on the effectiveness of technology-based activities, such as the use of GeoGebra, to develop spatial visual skills in students. The findings suggest the need to integrate this type of activity into engineering curricula to improve understanding of geometric concepts and performance in calculation tasks.",crítico

5," Playing a board game like chess has many benefits, such as cognitive and emotional development in children, and even the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in older adults, but these benefits are not available to people with motor impairment or in circumstances where two strangers cannot be very close. As a result of the above, it is necessary to develop a device to address these problems. This article presents the development of an alpha prototype of a chess board whose moves are controlled by voice through a mobile application and whose opponent is located remotely The prototype design consists of a square box of 38 cm x 38 cm x 7 cm where on the top is located the chessboard panel with the tricks, internally is located the Cartesian manipulator that moves the tricks throughout the board and the electronic control system that is formed by a series of easily replaceable components responsible for controlling and analyzing the movements made by the tricks on the board It also has a mobile application, which will have the function of converting the player's voice into a digital signal and sending it to the chessboard controller; it also provides the option to play remotely with someone else who owns the same chessboard. With the development of the prototype, the foundations were laid for subsequent improvements. It was observed, for example, that another game mode can be included by adding a sensor to the final effector of the manipulator to detect if there is a loophole in some locker."," By making chess more accessible, this prototype contributes to promoting cognitive and social development in people with disabilities and to fostering social interaction at a distance In addition, this device can be used as an educational tool to teach the principles of chess and programming.",Aplicado 
6," Working with wireless sensor networks (RIS) in urban areas is a complicated task, various factors must be taken into account due to the nature of the environment This is where analytical tools such as simulators play an important role in the success of networks. The aim of this work is to have a 3D virtual environment for the simulation of RIS that is reliable, scalable, modular and robust that allows certainty during the design of networks. In this work, the development of a 3D environment of the city of Torreón is presented, using the discrete event simulator OMNeT++, with tools from INET framework. The 3D simulation bed comprises a 1 km2 section of physical objects such as buildings and vegetation, the map of the city of Torreón and elevation data from the Topographic Shuttle Radar Mission (SRTM) Two comparative cases are presented between simulations and RIS data deployed in the city, obtaining the network efficiency and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), at different distances between nodes The first case study corresponds to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard at distances of 25, 50 and 100 m, and the second case to the proprietary mode of Texas Instruments Legacy Long Range at 90, 135 and 200 m. The results show an average match of 92% and 95% respectively in packets received between simulated data and those collected with the RIS As for the RSSI, it shows a behaviour in line with what was expected, weakening at greater distances. The 3D simulation bed is a reliable tool for simulating networks with different levels of complexity and scale, it facilitates having visual references and allows to understand the behavior of the RISs that are sought to design, serving as support in the efforts for air quality monitoring that exists in the region.", The proposed simulation platform offers great flexibility by allowing the simulation of different communication standards and urban scenarios. Its ability to model large areas and different types of obstacles makes it a useful tool for the design and evaluation of large-scale RIS networks., Aplicado
