0," Tactile care was administered to post-operative patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) wearing ventilators, and the effects of stress relief were tested compared to quiet time. It was aimed at people who had been admitted to the ICU with artificial respiratory devices after cardiovascular surgery. In the ward, the same subject was given tactile care after being sedated in a reclining position, then sedated again, and subsequently obtained data on subjective and objective indicators. The subjects were four men, with an average age of 64.3 years and 10.9 months, and there was no significant change in vital signs during or after tactile care. The results of the study showed that the levels of cortisol and oxytocin in the blood were lower than the rest of the subjects, while the rest of the subjects had lower scores on the State-Treat-Anxiety-Inventory-Form-JZ (STAI) scales, lower scores on the Pain-Visual-Analogue Scale (VAS), and higher scores on the Relaxation Scale (RAS). The study found that tactile care can be safe during the post-operative injury period, relieves subjective pain, anxiety, and has a relaxing effect and leads to stress relief."," This paper examined the effects of tactile care on post-operative patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) wearing artificial respirators and tested the effects of stress relief compared to quiet time. Tactile care has been suggested to be safe during the post-operative invasive injury period, to reduce subjective pain, anxiety, to have a relaxing effect, and to lead to stress relief.",Analytical
1," The case is a 55-year-old woman. He was diagnosed with shoulder and hip joint pain from X-2 and underwent a comprehensive internal medicine examination at the hospital, but was not diagnosed and underwent a follow-up examination in anti-seizure therapy. I've been diagnosed with vitiligo since I was a year old, and I've been treated at the eye hospital. In June of the same year, he was diagnosed with mixed ventilatory failure in a human dock lung examination, and in July, he was introduced to the department. A few days later, he had difficulty breathing during his labor, was admitted out of the ordinary, and heard a narrowing of the airways. A chest CT scan revealed a thick wall of airway cartilage and increased narrowness of the airway. He was diagnosed with respiratory distress due to bronchopneumonia and was hospitalized for further examination and treatment. The oxygenation was maintained indoors, and a full-body examination was performed. He admitted to mixed ventilation disorders with a narrowing of the upper airway in his respiratory test. The four items of Damiani's diagnostic criteria, non-infectious, seronegative inflammatory multiple arthritis, nasal cartilage, venous membrane inflammation, and airway cartilage, were found to be relevant and the diagnosis was confirmed as recurrent multiple cartilage inflammation. The company has approved the combination of prednisolone (1 mg per kg), inhaled steroids, and long-acting beta-2 stimulants for combination therapy to improve symptoms and respiratory distress. The prednisone-based treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of constipation, but it has not worsened. The study is based on the findings of a study of recurrent multiple sclerosis (MS) and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease through physical examination, such as nasal sclerosis, and is reported based on the literature."," This paper reports a case of a 55-year-old woman with recurrent multiple sclerosis who developed bronchial asthma, and points out the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.",Case study
2," It's a little bit of a stretch, but it's a little bit of a stretch. In March of the same year, he was admitted to a nearby doctor for abdominal pain accompanied by elevated liver enzymes, and a gallbladder removal surgery was performed to diagnose gallstones. After that, the symptoms were mild, but in June of the year X, he developed chest pain, jaundice, and was re-admitted to the nearby hospital. Blood tests showed elevated levels of hepatocellular enzymes and amylase. A breast tumor with CT scans and a closed-loop jaundice was confirmed and was referred to the hospital. In the ultrasound, an 8 mm low echo tumor was detected under the mucous membrane of the duodenum, and progression beyond the duodenum and into the common duct was confirmed. I suspected non-exposure duodenal breast cancer because of the lack of changes in the mucous membrane. After improving the inflammation, he performed an acupuncture under ultrasound for a breast tumor, but the malignancy was not recognized. He was hospitalized again in July of 'X' because of the denial of cancer, although the symptoms did not return. In endoscopic gallbladder surgery, the gallbladder was not narrowed by a breast tumor, and the breast was cut, but the tumor was not exposed. Even a biopsy of the incision did not confirm any malignancy. However, in August of the same year, EUS still had a breast tumor, and a breast reconstruction was performed, but no malignant cells were found. Although the possibility of cancer cannot be completely ruled out, benign diseases were also taken into account. Endoscopic papillectomy (EP) was performed to obtain a sufficient tissue sample. It led to a diagnosis of adenoma overgrowth rather than pathology of the sample. I've had one case where I've been diagnosed with adenomyomatous hyperplasia (AMH) by doing an EP on a submucosa tumor in the duodenum. AMH is a benign disease characterized by an increase in smooth muscle and adenovenous proliferation. Many of them appear in the gallbladder, and it's very rare for them to occur in the lower gallbladder, in the duodenum, in the breast, as in this case. I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it, and I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it. This case was also initially thought to be cancer, and multiple attempts were made to remove tissue using various endoscopic modalities, but the diagnosis was not made. In the end, we had to do an EP to get enough samples to make a pathological diagnosis. Although it is not without its complications, it is a useful treatment in the diagnosis of postoperative hemorrhage, twelve-finger-gut-breast-AMH, and is thought to help avoid unnecessary surgery.", This paper presents a case of a 43-year-old man who underwent endoscopic papillectomy (EP) and was diagnosed with adenomyomatous hyperplasia (AMH).,Case study
3," In osteoporosis (MPN), the number of platelets increases, and hypoglycemia is known. In the case of patients with chronic osteoporosis (CML), in addition to the increase in platelets, the patient also had a case of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia. The cases were men in their 50s, with a white blood cell count of 21.2 × 109 L, a platelet count of 4,165 × 109 L, a serum Ca value of 12.5 mg/dL, an IP value of 4.7 mg/dL and a K value of 6.9 mmol/L. The BCR-ABL gene was detected in chromosome tests at t(9;22)(q34;q11), and the BCR-ABL gene was detected in genetic testing and diagnosed with CML. The difference between the Ca, IP, and K serums in the hospital test (Δ) was 3.7 mg Ca, 1.2 mg K, and 3.0 mmol L, and both serums showed higher values than the serums. After this, the platelet counts at weeks 2, 3, and 4 decreased by 3,419, 1, 847, 713 × 109, L respectively, with ΔCa decreased by 2.9, 1.7, 1.0 mg/dL, ΔIP by 0.6, 0.5, 0.3 mg/dL, and ΔK by 2.1, 1.6, 0.7 mmol/L. For comparison with this case, I asked for ΔCa, ΔIP, ΔK in the MPN22 case (blood platelet count 492<unk>1,712×109<unk>L). As a result, the average ± SD of ΔCa was 0.1±0.3 mg/dL, the ΔIP was 0.2±0.3 mg/dL, and the ΔK was 0.7±0.3 mmolL. The most common of the 22 samples had a platelet count of 1,712 × 109 L, a Ca of 0.6 mg/dL, an IP of 0.8 mg/dL, and a K of 1.8 mmol/L. This case was accompanied by a decrease in platelet count, and the difference between the Ca, IP, and K values of the serum and the plasma was also reduced. If we look at this sequence, K and IP are the main positive and negative ions in the cell, respectively, and it is assumed that they are released by blood clotting. Ca is thought to be released by the clotting of calcium deposits in the densitubular system, concentrated particles, etc. in the platelets, accompanied by the activation of platelet function by platelet enlargement. In the case of significant platelet growth, it should be noted that not only is the serum electrolyte K, but the Ca and IP values can also be false highs."," In this paper, we present cases of hypocritical hypokalemia and hypocritical hypokalemia and hypocritical hypokalemia with hypocritical hypokalemia due to increased platelet count in patients with chronic osteoporosis (CML).",Case study
4," The company has developed a rapid, simple, non-toxic, ammonia-based nitrogen measurement method using phenol, a harmful substance, and developed a continuous flow analysis (CFA) analysis method. To prevent interference with measurements by metal ions in the sample, ethylene diamine tetrahydrate (EDTA) was added. And to reduce interference with the coloration mechanism by EDTA and prevent the effects of jamming, we used a PTFE membrane filter air-liquid separator. The liquid separator separated only the ammonia in the sample in a gaseous form and measured it using the salicylic acid-indifenol method, making it possible to analyze it without the use of phenol and without the influence of interfering substances. He used this method and the conventional method of using phenol to measure seawater, factory wastewater, etc., and found that comparing the two would yield the same result. The results of the evaluation and statistical analysis of the measurement method itself also confirmed that there is no significant difference between this method and the conventional method. It has been suggested that this law has the same measurement power as the conventional law and can be substituted for the conventional law."," In this paper, we propose a rapid, simple ammonia nitrogen measurement method that does not use phenol, which is an alternative to conventional methods and is a harmful substance.",Methodological
5," Parathyroid dystrophy is classified into various clinical types. In this case, the cerebellum-brain stem type is rare, and the symptoms and images are similar to spinal cerebellar degeneration, making it difficult to diagnose. We're going to do a post-mortem examination as a spinal cord injury, and we're going to report a case that was ultimately diagnosed with cerebrospinal-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain-brain. He developed post-adult psychiatric symptoms that led to a psychiatric evaluation, and then he was admitted to the hospital's neurosurgery department for a walking disorder. The first MRI showed abnormal signals in various parts of the brain, such as the cerebellum and the bridge, the medial cerebellum, the cerebral artery, the lower back of the visual cortex, and the outer part of the brain. During the post-mortem examination as an SCD, he was re-examined for worsening symptoms and MRI scans, and was diagnosed with subarachnoid dystrophy. I think the abnormal signals from the visual cortex and the midbrain are equivalent to the inner knee and the lower arm, respectively. They constitute the auditory pathway and are one of the evaluation items of Loesscore, the image evaluation method for subcutaneous white matter dystrophy. Recognizing abnormal signals in both auditory pathways may help accurately diagnose X-ALD."," In this paper, we have reported cases diagnosed with cerebrospinal cerebellar dystrophy, a sub-leukemia of the cerebellum and cerebellum, by conducting a passive observation as a sub-spinal cerebellar dystrophy and ultimately recognizing abnormal signals in both auditory pathways.",Case study
6," A fractured thumb is a common injury in orthopedic surgery, but it's less of a problem if you follow its treatment principles. But there are still cases of easy appendage fixation, inadequate surgical treatment, post-operative management, post-operative rehabilitation, and the emergence of tendonitis. In particular, the latter complications are prominent and can lead to disability of the entire hand. This article discusses the points to understand when treating a basal bone fracture and the surgical remedies for complications. The choice of surgery or conservative therapy in early response and early treatment should be determined by individual cases. The diagnosis of a fracture is, of course, based on the degree of understanding of the injury, the social background, i.e. age, type of insurance (health insurance, work-related disaster, self-induced injury, etc.), underlying diseases and complications, the content of the trauma, and the treatment content, including the acceptance of post-treatment.", This paper describes the points to understand during treatment of a basal bone fracture and the surgical remedies for complications.,Survey
7," I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it, and I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it, and I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it. The first year of S.L.I.T. treatment, 84 cases, the second year, 107 cases, the third year, 67 cases. In 2023, the nasal eye and general symptoms of the Sugi-Hinoki period were examined on the Visual Analysis Scale (VAS). The symptoms of the early stages were significantly reduced with more years of treatment, but were much larger in the early stages. Strong cases of consciousness symptoms in the nasal phase before SLIT were only 0.9-3.6% higher than in the nasal phase during the nasal phase, but in the VAS in the third year of treatment with SLIT, the nasal swelling, nasal swelling, and general symptoms were higher than in the nasal phase during the nasal phase. The overall symptoms of the early stages of VAS were not affected by the number of pollen spills, and the complete cure rate was affected by the third year of SLIT. Even in the years of large-scale flying, the effects of SGI SLIT on SGI pollen were high, and the effects increased with age, but there was a worsening of symptoms due to VAS in Hinoki pollen in the years of age."," In this paper, we examined the effects of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on psoriasis and rhinitis, and concluded that the effects of SLIT on psoriasis were high even in years of mass dispersion, and the effects increased year by year, but rhinitis had worsening symptoms due to the visual analogy scale (VAS) year by year.",Analytical
8," The advances in drug therapy since 2010 have made a breakthrough in the treatment of melanoma, and it's still in the midst of a development race to improve treatment outcomes. The transition from the era of cell-killing anticancer drugs to molecular targeted therapies and immunotherapies has led to the well-known combination of BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors for melanoma BRAF gene mutations as a molecular targeted treatment for skin cancer. In immunotherapy, new treatments targeting CTLA-4 and LAG-3 have emerged, including PD-1, PD-L1 in epidermal skin malignancies such as melanoma, Merkel cell cancer, and thorny cell cancer. The new drug, which is based on a combination of the drug's name and its evidence, and the results of a genetic panel, is expected to be the first step in a major change in the treatment system.", This paper introduces new drug treatments for melanoma and discusses changes in the future treatment system through early implementation of cancer genetic panel testing.,Survey
9," Although the introduction of the current cyclin-dependent kinase 4-4-6 (CDK6) inhibitor has improved treatment outcomes, severe interstitial lung disease, including deaths thought to be caused by CDK-4-6 inhibitors, has also been reported. The case is a 78-year-old woman who had been treated for breast cancer for six years, but had a relapse in the right clavicle lymph node and began radiation therapy with full-busted and parvo-script. I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it, and I'm going to put a little bit of salt in it. The second round of steroid pulse therapy resulted in an improvement in pulmonary shadow and breathing difficulties. The lungs are fibrous, and oxygen therapy has been introduced at home, but it's possible to live a normal life.", This paper presents cases of severe interstitial lung disease in which a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 6 (CDK 4 6) inhibitor was used to treat breast cancer.,Case study
