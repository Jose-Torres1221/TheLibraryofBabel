" the effects of turgor pressure - induced membrane tension on junctional coupling of hensen cell isolates from the inner ear were evaluated by input capacitance or transjunctional conductance measurement techniques . turgor pressure was altered by changing either pipette pressure or the osmolarities of extracellular solutions . both positive pipette pressure and extracellular applications of hypotonic solutions , which caused cell size to concomitantly increase , uncoupled the cells as indicated by reduced input capacitance and transjunctional conductance . these changes were , in many cases , reversible and repeatable . intracellular application of 50 m h-7 , a broad - based protein kinase inhibitor , and 10 mm bapta did not block the uncoupling effect of positive turgor pressure on inner ear gap junctions . the transjunctional conductance at a holding potential of 80 mv was 53.6 5.8 ns ( mean  sem , n = 9 ) and decreased 40% at a turgor pressure of 1.41  0.05 kpa . considering the coincident kinetics of cell deformation and uncoupling , we speculate that mechanical forces work directly on gap junctions of the inner ear . these results suggest that pathologies that induce imbalances in cochlear osmotic pressure regulation may compromise normal cochlear homeostasis .

" previous 
 work describes a computational solvation model called semi - explicit 
 assembly ( sea ) . 
 the sea water model computes the free energies of 
 solvation of nonpolar and polar solutes in water with good efficiency 
 and accuracy . 
 however , sea gives systematic errors in the solvation 
 free energies of ions and charged solutes . 
 here , we describe field - sea , 
 an improved treatment that gives accurate solvation free energies 
 of charged solutes , including monatomic and polyatomic ions and model 
 dipeptides , as well as nonpolar and polar molecules . field - sea is 
 computationally inexpensive for a given solute because explicit - solvent 
 model simulations are relegated to a precomputation step and because 
 it represents solvating waters in terms of a solute s free - energy 
 field . 
 in essence , field - sea approximates the physics of explicit - model 
 simulations within a computationally efficient framework . 
 a key finding 
 is that an atom s solvation shell inherits characteristics 
 of a neighboring atom , especially strongly charged neighbors . 
 field - sea 
 may be useful where there is a need for solvation free - energy computations 
 that are faster than explicit - solvent simulations and more accurate 
 than traditional implicit - solvent simulations for a wide range of 
 solutes . ","The paper introduces a new computational model called Field-SEA, which provides accurate solvation free energies for various solutes, including charged and uncharged molecules.

" abstractthe purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of 
 immunoelectron microscopic observation of endocrine cells in paraffin - embedded tissues . 
 
 the procedure , which involves reprocessing from sliced tissues and immunohistochemical 
 staining by colloidal - gold immunolabeling of paraffin sections from paraffin blocks , was 
 able to reveal the fine characteristics of secretory granules containing glucagon - like 
 peptide-1 . 
 morphometric analyses of the secretory granules showed no significant 
 differences between the reprocessing procedure and a conventional post - embedding 
 procedure , which was performed as a control . 
 the reprocessing procedure has some 
 advantages besides providing information on secretory granules containing the amino acid 
 peptide . 
 for example , the same cell can be observed under both a light microscope and the 
 electron microscope . 
 in addition , the high - electron densities of silver - enhanced gold 
 particles are easily recognized , and the boundary between the profile of the granules and 
 the immunogold labeling is clearly shown at the electron microscopic level . furthermore , 
 the procedure , which is inexpensive and does not require special devices , can effectively 
 use precious samples that are already paraffin - embedded and unable to be obtained twice , 
 such as the case for endangered animals and rare pathological tissues . to the best of our 
 knowledge ,

" imaging through the visual system in alzheimer 's disease , with the technology currently in widespread use for the diagnosis and management of eye disease such as glaucoma and macular degeneration , is proving to be promising . in vivo cross - section imaging during an annual comprehensive eye exam has been available for a decade for glaucoma and macular degeneration , and this same imaging , using optical coherence tomography , has been demonstrated to show deficits specific to ad and mild cognitive impairment . 
 these deficits are in the form of nerve fiber layer tissue drop out in the retina and optic nerve . 
 the retrograde loss of nerve fiber layer tissue in the retina and optic nerve may be an early biomarker of ad , and these deficits in the nerve fiber layer of the retina and optic nerve may be the earliest sign of ad , even prior to damage to the hippocampal region that impacts memory . ","The study suggests that eye imaging techniques, like optical coherence tomography, can detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

 isolates of this clonal complex were more resistant than other isolates to human serum . ",This study investigates the resistance of the campylobacter jejuni bacteria by studying blood samples from Finland. They found that one strain was found to be more resistant.,Experimental
" a diverse group of the pathologic process can produce the enlargement of soft tissues in the oral cavity and often present a diagnostic challenge . 
 this soft tissue enlargement may represent a variation of the normal anatomic structure , inflammatory reaction , cyst , neoplasm , and developmental anomalies . 
 a group of reactive hyperplasias , which develop in response to chronic recurring tissue injury that stimulates an excessive tissue repair response . 
 the pyogenic granuloma ( pg ) is a reactive enlargement that is an inflammatory response to local irritation such as calculus , a fractured tooth , rough dental restoration , and foreign materials or hormonal ( pregnancy tumor ) and rarely associated with bone loss . 
 this paper presents a rare case of pg associated with periodontal abscess and bone loss in a 30-year - old male . ","The paper discusses a rare case of pyogenic granuloma (PG) associated with periodontal abscess and bone loss. PG is typically a benign inflammatory response to local irritation, but in this case, it presented with more severe features. This case highlights the importance of considering PG as a differential diagnosis for soft tissue enlargements in the oral cavity, even in cases with atypical presentations.",Case Study
" sirtuins are nad+-dependent protein deacetylases and mediate adaptive responses to a variety of stresses , including calorie restriction and metabolic stress . 
 sirtuin 3 ( sirt3 ) is localized in the mitochondrial matrix where it regulates the acetylation levels of metabolic enzymes , including acetyl coenzyme a synthetase 21,2 . 
 mice lacking both sirt3 alleles appear phenotypically normal under basal conditions , but show marked hyperacetylation of several mitochondrial proteins3 . 
 we report that sirt3 expression is upregulated during fasting in liver and brown adipose tissues . 
 livers from mice lacking sirt3 show higher levels of fatty acid oxidation intermediate products and triglycerides during fasting associated with decreased levels of fatty acid oxidation when compared to wild - type mice . 
 mass spectrometry analysis of mitochondrial proteins shows that long - chain acyl coa dehydrogenase ( lcad ) is hyperacetylated at lysine 42 in the absence of sirt3 . 
 lcad is deacetylated in wild - type mice under fasted conditions and by sirt3 in vitro and in vivo , and hyperacetylation of lcad reduces its enzymatic activity . 
 mice lacking sirt3 exhibit hallmarks of fatty acid oxidation disorders during fasting including reduced atp levels and intolerance to cold exposure . 
 these findings identify acetylation as a novel regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and demonstrate that sirt3 modulates mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and fatty acid utilization during fasting . ","The study investigates the role of Sirt3, a mitochondrial protein deacetylase, in regulating fatty acid metabolism during fasting. They found that Sirt3 is upregulated during fasting and deacetylates long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. Mice lacking Sirt3 exhibit impaired fatty acid oxidation, leading to reduced ATP levels and cold intolerance. These findings highlight the importance of Sirt3 in maintaining metabolic homeostasis during fasting.",Experimental

" 
 objective . this study aimed to compare the prevalence and morbidity data on schistosoma mansoni infection in two rural areas : the jequitinhonha valley ( area 1 ) and the rio doce valley ( area 2 ) in the state of minas gerais , brazil , covering the period from 2007 to 2010 . 
 material and methods . 
 the parasitological stool tests were based on the quantitative method of kato modified by katz et al . 
 three clinical forms were considered : type i  schistosomiasis infection , type ii  
 hepatointestinal form , and type iii  
 hepatosplenic form . results . 
 the prevalence of infection among inhabitants of area 1 was 22.9% , with 2.1% presenting the hepatosplenic form and two cases of schistosomal myeloradiculopathy . 
 the infection prevalence rate in area 2 was 20.2% , with 3.3% presenting the hepatosplenic form . 
 conclusion and recommendation . 
 there was no difference in the prevalence and in the morbidity of schistosoma mansoni infection between the two areas , but it was predominant in young men with a low intensity of infection . 
 the cases of schistosomal myeloradiculopathy in area 1 can be highlighted : these emphasize that schistosomiasis should not be neglected in brazil . 
 the lack of infection control in both areas may be related to the poor sanitation system , the absence of previous treatment , and the reinfection process . ","The study compared the prevalence and morbidity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in two rural areas of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Both areas showed similar prevalence rates, with a significant number of cases presenting with the hepatosplenic form of the disease. The study highlights the importance of continued surveillance and control efforts to prevent the spread of schistosomiasis in these regions.",Comparative
" refractory bleeding following percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is mainly due to formation of pseudoaneurysm . 
 transarterial embolization is required to control the bleeding in such cases . 
 we report a case of post - pcnl hematuria in whom angioembolization was done . 
 an early erosion of the embolization coil from the renal vasculature into the urinary collecting system occurred , causing urinary tract obstruction and urinary tract infection ( uti ) . 
 the coil was retrieved ureteroscopically after control of uti with antibiotics . 
 migration of embolization coil into urinary collecting system is a rare but important cause of urinary tract obstruction . 
 the treating physician as well as the patient should be aware of this complication . ",The study reports a rare case of a migrated embolization coil after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) for refractory bleeding. This led to urinary tract obstruction and infection.

" backgroundfollicular thyroid cancer ( ftc ) metastasizes most commonly to the lungs and non - cranial bones . 
 skull and skin are uncommon sites and usually manifest well after the diagnosis of primary malignancy . 
 metastasis to skull and skin as the presenting feature of ftc is infrequently reported in the literature.case presentationa 65-year - old caucasian woman with a history of thyroid nodule presented with the complaint of rapidly growing skull nodules which had been present for 3 years but were stable previously . 
 she denied any fevers , chills , history of trauma , or weight loss . 
 she denied any history of smoking or head and neck irradiation . on physical examination , 
 she had two non - tender gray cystic lesions  one on her left temporal region and the other on the right parietal region . 
 biopsy was consistent with metastatic ftc . 
 magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated 7.13.8 cm and 3.74.5 cm fairly homogeneous , enhancing , relatively well - defined masses centered in the posterior and left anterior lateral calvarium with intracranial and extracranial extensions but without any vasogenic edema or mass effect on the brain . 
 thyroid ultrasound showed numerous nodules in both lobes . 
 the patient underwent a total thyroidectomy . 
 histopathological studies of the thyroid gland revealed a well - differentiated ftc in the left lobe . 
 then she underwent resection of the tumor in multiple stages . 
 she did not have any recurrence of the ftc or metastases during the follow - up period and will be receiving radioactive iodine treatment.conclusionbone and lung are the common sites of metastasis from ftc , but involvement of skull or skin is unusual , particularly as the presenting feature . 
 metastases from ftc should be in the differential of patients with new osteolytic hypervascular skull lesions or cutaneous lesions in head and neck area . ","The study presents a rare case of follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) that spread to the skull and scalp, presenting as rapidly growing nodules. This is unusual because FTC typically spreads to the lungs and bones. The patient underwent surgery to remove the thyroid gland and skull tumors, and will receive radioactive iodine treatment.

" an abiotic formation of meso- and dl - tartrates in 80% yield via the cyanide - catalyzed 
 dimerization 
 of glyoxylate under alkaline conditions is demonstrated . 
 a detailed 
 mechanism for this conversion is proposed , supported by nmr evidence 
 and 13c - labeled reactions . 
 simple dehydration of tartrates 
 to oxaloacetate and an ensuing decarboxylation to form pyruvate are 
 known processes that provide a ready feedstock for entry into the 
 citric acid cycle . while glyoxylate and high hydroxide concentration 
 are atypical in the prebiotic literature , there is evidence for natural , 
 abiotic availability of each .
