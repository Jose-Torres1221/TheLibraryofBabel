1,"endothelial dysfunction and oxldl are believed to be early and critical events in atherogenesis. 6-shogaol is the major bioactive compound present in zingiber officinale and possesses the anti - atherosclerotic effect. however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of 6-shogaol on oxldl - induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) injuries and its possible molecular mechanisms. hence, we studied the effects of 6-shogaol on cell apoptosis, cellular reactive oxygen species (ros), nf-b activation, bcl-2 expression, and caspase -3, -8, -9 activities. in addition, e - selectin, mcp-1, and icam-1 were determined by elisa. our study show that oxldl increased lox-1 expression, ros levels, nf-b, caspases-9 and -3 activation and decreased bcl-2 expression in huvecs. these alterations were attenuated by 6-shogaol. cotreatment with 6-shogaol and sirna of lox-1 synergistically reduced oxldl - induced caspases -9, -3 activities and cell apoptosis. overexpression of lox-1 attenuated the protection by 6-shogaol and uppressed the effects of 6-shogaol on oxldl - induced oxidative stress. in addition, oxldl enhanced the activation of nf-b and expression of adhesion molecules. pretreatment with 6-shogaol, however, exerted significant toprotective effects in all events. our data indicate that 6-shogaol might be a potential natural antiapoptotic agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",this paper analyses the effects of 6-shogaol on oxldl with the results showing that 6-shogaol potential for being a natural antiapoptotic agent for the treatment of atherosclerosis.,experimental
2,"objective : the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of three dentine bonding agents (g - bond, clearfil s3 bond and clearfil se bond x) in cell - culture perfusion.methods:in this experiment, 8104 tcpc sv40 cells (bovine - pulp - derived cells transfected with simian virus 40 large t - antigen) in mem - alpha media, 20%fcs were seeded on mesh in a 6-well plate and incubated at 37 c with 5% co2. after 2 days, the mesh inserts were transferred to a 24-well plate and incubated in mem - alpha media, 20%fcs with 50 g / ml of ascorbic acid at 37 c with 5% co2 for 14 days. the test materials were applied to the dentine discs of dentine barrier models. three - dimensional cell cultures in mesh and perfusion conditions were generated in this experiment. each material, as well as the negative control (president) and the positive control (vitrebond), was tested in 5 models with the tests repeated in triplicate. the mtt assay was used to determine cell viability after the diffusion of leachable toxicity from the tested materials through the dentine discs.results:the cell survival rate with g - bond and clearfil s3 bond was 113.03 and 90.98 percent, respectively, whereas that with clearfil se bond x was 111.83 percent. all three dentine bonding agents had no toxicity compared with the negative control group (p>.05).conclusions : all three self - etching dentine - bonding agents are nontoxic. pulp damage caused by these three bonding agents is unlikely to occur in the clinic.","this paper analyses three dentine bonding agents (g-bond, clearfil s3 bond, and clearfil se bond x) for cell perfusion. the results of this paper show that these agents are nontoxic and pulp damaged caused by these bonding agents is unlikely to occur in the clinic.",experimental

4,"the effects of turgor pressure - induced membrane tension on junctional coupling of hensen cell isolates from the inner ear were evaluated by input capacitance or transjunctional conductance measurement techniques. turgor pressure was altered by changing either pipette pressure or the osmolarities of extracellular solutions. both positive pipette pressure and extracellular applications of hypotonic solutions, which caused cell size to concomitantly increase, uncoupled the cells as indicated by reduced input capacitance and transjunctional conductance. these changes were, in many cases, reversible and repeatable. intracellular application of 50 m h-7, a broad - based protein kinase inhibitor, and 10 mm bapta did not block the uncoupling effect of positive turgor pressure on inner ear gap junctions. the transjunctional conductance at a holding potential of 80 mv was 53.6 5.8 ns (mean sem, n = 9) and decreased 40% at a turgor pressure of 1.41 0.05 kpa. considering the coincident kinetics of cell deformation and uncoupling, we speculate that mechanical forces work directly on gap junctions of the inner ear. these results suggest that pathologies that induce imbalances in cochlear osmotic pressure regulation may compromise normal cochlear homeostasis.","the paper explores how changes in cell pressure affect the connections between hensen cells in the inner ear. the researchers found that increasing cell pressure can weaken these connections, potentially impacting hearing.",experimental

6,"the routine use of 18f - fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography (pet)/computed tomography scans for staging and assessment of treatment response for cancer has resulted in a large number of thyroid abnormalities being detected as incidental findings (incidentalomas). since most pet / ct scans are performed in the setting of a known nonthyroid malignancy, the need for incidentalomas to be further investigated and managed depends on the stage, prognosis, and current treatment plan for the known malignancy. we present a case describing the management of an incidental f - fluorodeoxyglucose - avid thyroid nodule detected in a patient with known metastatic colorectal cancer. on the basis of this case, we discuss the management of incidental pet - detected thyroid nodules in patients with metastatic cancer. thyroid incidentalomas must be seen in the context of the prognosis and treatment plan for the known malignancy.",the study discusses the management of incidental thyroid nodules found during pet/ct scans for cancer patients. it highlights the importance of considering the patients overall prognosis and treatment plan when deciding on further investigation and management of these nodules.,case study
7,"previous work describes a computational solvation model called semi - explicit assembly (sea). the sea water model computes the free energies of solvation of nonpolar and polar solutes in water with good efficiency and accuracy. however, sea gives systematic errors in the solvation free energies of ions and charged solutes. here, we describe field - sea, an improved treatment that gives accurate solvation free energies of charged solutes, including monatomic and polyatomic ions and model dipeptides, as well as nonpolar and polar molecules. field - sea is computationally inexpensive for a given solute because explicit - solvent model simulations are relegated to a precomputation step and because it represents solvating waters in terms of a solute s free - energy field. in essence, field - sea approximates the physics of explicit - model simulations within a computationally efficient framework. a key finding is that an atom s solvation shell inherits characteristics of a neighboring atom, especially strongly charged neighbors. field - sea may be useful where there is a need for solvation free - energy computations that are faster than explicit - solvent simulations and more accurate than traditional implicit - solvent simulations for a wide range of solutes.","the paper introduces a new computational model called field-sea, which provides accurate solvation free energies for various solutes, including charged and uncharged molecules. this model is more efficient than traditional explicit-solvent simulations while being more accurate than implicit-solvent models. it achieves this by using a precomputation step to represent solvating water molecules as a solutes free energy field.",analytical
8,"abstractthe purpose of the present study was to investigate the possibility of immunoelectron microscopic observation of endocrine cells in paraffin - embedded tissues. the procedure, which involves reprocessing from sliced tissues and immunohistochemical staining by colloidal - gold immunolabeling of paraffin sections from paraffin blocks, was able to reveal the fine characteristics of secretory granules containing glucagon - like peptide-1. morphometric analyses of the secretory granules showed no significant differences between the reprocessing procedure and a conventional post - embedding procedure, which was performed as a control. the reprocessing procedure has some advantages besides providing information on secretory granules containing the amino acid peptide. for example, the same cell can be observed under both a light microscope and the electron microscope. in addition, the high - electron densities of silver - enhanced gold particles are easily recognized, and the boundary between the profile of the granules and the immunogold labeling is clearly shown at the electron microscopic level. furthermore, the procedure, which is inexpensive and does not require special devices, can effectively use precious samples that are already paraffin - embedded and unable to be obtained twice, such as the case for endangered animals and rare pathological tissues. to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the advantages of the reprocessing method for sliced paraffin sections of gut endocrine cells.","the study describes a new method for visualizing endocrine cells in paraffin-embedded tissues using electron microscopy. this method allows researchers to study the fine structure of these cells and their secretory granules, providing valuable insights into their function.",experimental

56,"introduction : peritonitis is one of the most common problems in general surgery practice with high mortality rate. one of the reasons for high mortality is that peritonitis affects the general condition and leads to complications causing multiple organ failure, renal failure, sepsis, and postoperative ventilatory support. early prognostic evaluation of patients with peritonitis is desirable to select high - risk patients for intensive management and also to provide a reliable objective classification of severity and operative risk.patients and methods : fifty cases with diagnosis of peritonitis coming to government medical college, amritsar, were studied. stratification of these patients was done according to mannheim peritonitis index (mpi), and their outcome was examined.results:mortality steadily increases with increase in mpi score. for patients with a score < 21, the mortality rate was 0% ; for score 2127, it was 27.28% ; and for score > 27, it was 100% (p < 0.001). for patients with a score < 21, the morbidity rate was 13.33% ; for score 21 - 27, it was 65.71% ; and for score > 27, it was 100% (p < 0.001). duration of pain > 24 h, organ failure on admission, female sex, and feculent exudate were found to be independently significant factors in predicting the mortality among the study population. for a score of 27, the sensitivity was 66.67%, specificity was 100%, and positive predictive value for mortality is 100% at an accuracy of 94%.conclusion : this study proves that mpi scoring system is a simple and effective tool for assessing the morbidity and mortality in patients with peritonitis.",the paper propose that mannheim peritonitis index system is a simple and effective tool for assesing the morbidity and mortality in parients with peritonitis.,analytical
57,"pre - emptive living donor transplantation should always be promoted as the first - line treatment for kidney failure. where that is not possible, patients must receive timely information and advice regarding all dialysis options available, including home - based peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. where a dialysis unit enables and actively encourages self - management, patients will tend to select themselves, and if well motivated may overcome significant difficulties to exceed the expectations or predictions of dialysis staff. patients then become advocates themselves and can provide other patients with the necessary motivation to consider a home treatment, such that they approach staff, rather than vice versa. for staff to be able to talk to patients with confidence requires direct experience of home dialysis, but in units which do not have a full range of home therapies, this may initially be difficult. visiting patients in their home environment is an essential part of training for both medical and nursing staff. before a patient is able to begin to engage in discussion about any dialysis therapy, they must have reached a point of acceptance that dialysis is necessary. if they are not at this point, then any attempt at education will be largely futile. once a patient has arrived at the point of choosing a home therapy, the pathway to their first dialysis at home must be as smooth and problem - free as possible.",the paper argue that pre-emptibe living donor transplantation should always s be promoted as the first-line treatment for kidney failure.,argumentative
